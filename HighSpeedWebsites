*** HIGH SPEED WEBSITES ***

  A. Optimal speed requires thoughtfulness at every level from the operating system, DNS, network, front and backend archetecture, languages and databases used, care in coding, etc.
  
  B. Speed killers
    1. Images that are not properly sized nor optimized, and in large numbers
    2. High number of http requests
    3. Inserting Javascript before HTML
    4. Large number of bells and whistles
    5. Network latency
    6. Distance between server and user
    7. Unmaintained databases
    8. Non use of caching tools
    9. Non use of CDN for static content
    
  C. High Speed Best Practices
    1. Sparing use of images
    2. Use correctly sized and optimized images
    3. Limit number of HTTP requests
    4. Put Javascript after HTML and CSS
    5. Make sure only required CSS is in the CSS file
    6. Minify both CSS and HTML
    7. Compile Javascript when possible
    8. Reduce dependencies such as jQuery as much as possible
    9. Have servers on every continent where there is high usage
    10. Use caching tools
    11. Use a CDN to serve static content
    12. Mainain databases so that only relavent data is stored on high io devices
    13. Implement patches and updates regularly
    
  D. Databases / Data Storage
    1. Use NoSQL databases when possible
    2. Use a Relational Database Serivce (RDS) with Amazon ElastiCache or similar caching tool when NoSQL is not possible
    3. Prune databases regularly so that old and unnecessary data does not needlessly buildup
    4. Make sure databases are properly indexed to minimize unnecessary load
    5. Make sure software that accesses databases run efficient queries and terminates when queries complete
    6. Make sure that software and database are geographically close to each other, prefereable in the same datacenter
    7. Make efficient use of master / slave architecture
