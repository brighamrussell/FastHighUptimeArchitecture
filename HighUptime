*** ULTRA HIGH UPTIME ***

A. Causes of Downtime
  1. Changes of any kind, including updating code, host, DNS, network, etc.
  2. Poor architecture, such as lack of redundancy / load ballancing
  3. Attacks
  4. Failure to keep things updates such as SSL certificate, domain registration, patches, etc.

B. Uptime Best Practices
  1. Design redundancy into everything
  2. Always implement changes in a test environment before making changes to a production environment 
  3. Set alerts to remind when subscriptions or certificates need to be updated
  4. Monitor all applications, network connections, daemons, hardware, loads, and changes
